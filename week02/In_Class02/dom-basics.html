    Type document. (don't forget the . at the end) in the prompt area of the console (should be at the bottom of the console) in the browser developer tools. But don't hit 'enter/return'. Notice the long list of options that pops up. Those are all things we can do with the document. Review the list.

Since all of the elements the users sees live in the body element, we are provided a shortcut to it: document.body.

Notice that we can also look at the children and parentElement of body. We could if we wanted traverse anywhere in our page by using these...it's a bit tedious though, so we have been given shortcuts: document.getElementById and document.querySelector

Type document.body.innerText then 'enter', then try document.body.innerHTML and 'enter'. Notice the difference.

Try doing this: document.body.innerHTML = 'Hello World' What happened?

Refresh your browser to get the page back.

Now try this: document.getElementById('p2').innerText = 'Hello World' That worked a bit better.

querySelector is more flexible that getElementById. It uses valid CSS selectors. To get the element with id='p2' with quertSelector we would need to add a '#' like this:
document.querySelector('#p2')

You can also get elements with classes. Try document.querySelector('.green') The '.' tells the browser to look for a class.

What if we wanted figure out which section the paragraph in the last step belonged to? for the first section since the <section> is the parent in this case we could do document.querySelector('.green').parent, but that won't work for the second. Instead we can also do something like this:

const greenP = document.querySelector('.green');
const parentSection = greenP.closest('section');`.
That will traverse up the DOM starting with the green P until it finds an ancestor that is a section. Very useful!

to get all paragraphs we could do this: document.querySelector('p')

Did you notice that there is also a document.querySelectorAll? Try it with 'p'
